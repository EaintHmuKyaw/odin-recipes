    <h2>Chef John's Greatest Grilled Chicken Recipes</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti carbonara is a traditional Italian dish known for its creamy, indulgent flavor that melds beautifully with a simple yet rich array of ingredients. At its heart, the dish features al dente spaghetti enveloped in a smooth, velvety sauce made from eggs, freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous helping of cracked black pepper. The sauce clings to every strand, ensuring each forkful is as flavorful as the last. Bits of crispy pancetta are scattered throughout, offering a salty crunch that contrasts the creamy pasta. This dish, often garnished with a sprinkle of parsley, serves as a comforting reminder of the rustic, hearty cuisine of Italy.</p>

    <h2>Brief steps to make spaghetti carbonara:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pancetta:</strong>strong> While the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until it is crispy and the fat is rendered.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine:</strong>  Drain the pasta and reserve some of the cooking water. Quickly add the hot pasta to the skillet with the pancetta. Remove from heat to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing vigorously to coat the pasta and create a creamy sauce. Add a little reserved pasta water if the sauce is too thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve immediately, garnished with additional Pecorino Romano cheese, black pepper, and optional chopped parsley.</li>
